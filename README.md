# Cookbook

1. Create a local database
Use MySQL Workbench to open the cookbook_db.mwb file in the root folder of the program. Use this mwb file and Workbenchâ€™s forward engineer function to create the database and its tables.

2. Virtual Environment
Open the root folder of the program in an IDE of your choice (we used visual studio code.) Use command pipenv shell to start a virtual environment.

3. Start The Application 
Use command python server.py to start the application. Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000/ to see the running application.
